# Hello

Hi from Oakland. 

This repository collects links to code projects I've worked
on or think about. 

# Projects

Links to things I've made in various levels of bitrot:

- [Date String Formatter](http://time-formats.dbelford.com/) (used Angular 1.0 probably)
- [Color Picker](http://dbelford.com/colorful/) (Bootstrap and Angular 1.0)
- [Itineraries](github.com/dbelford/itineraries) a Jekyll based site for collecting day trips [demo](http://www.wongjennifer.com/itineraries/)
- [Obj-C Library Browser](http://dbelford.github.io/Obj-Compendium/#) (using Jquery) like an awesome list before I learned of those
- [Note Taking Journal](https://github.com/dbelford/hugo-journal-theme) A hugo theme [demo](https://journal.dbelford.com) 
  - I use Purescript watcher/Makefile to turn Notational Velocity style note taking dbs (nvAlt) into a searchable webpage
- [Personal Website](dbelford.com)

And there's probably a dozen more piles of project code somewhere...

# Languages

I've tried out many languages and generally decided I like statically typed languages that have IDEs.

I've tried making things with ActionScript 2, 3, 4, Obj-C, Swift, Javascript, Typescript, Jquery, Angular 1, React.

I've tinkered a little bit with Haskell, Purescript, Go, Ruby and taken classes using Python, Scheme.

I've read K&R and C++ in 21 days.

At this point I'm looking for one ecosystem I can spend most of my time in.
